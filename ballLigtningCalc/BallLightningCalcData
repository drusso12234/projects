radius = 22 * radiusMod
projSpeed = 48 * projSpeedMod
HITINTERVAL = 150 ms
ENEMYRADIUS = 3

To access the command-line argument inside a java program is quite easy, they are stored as string in String array passed to the args parameter of main() method.

arg0 = radiusMod
arg1 = projSpeedMod
arg2 = BallLightningAverageHit


assuming you are sending out a constant stream of balls, damage starts the moment the first ball is within the range of the enemy


ball starts at 0 -- has a range around itself of (radius) units -- so it can hit from (0 - radius) to (0 + radius)

enemy will start at (0 + radius). will not move

ball moves at (projSpeed) units per second. Going to operate program at 50ms(?) intervals.

Need to start a new ball at 0 each time a ball would be shot. Already have all balls in an arraylist, is that right?
